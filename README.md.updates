# Session Persistence Feature

This update adds session persistence to the application. Sessions will now be maintained between application restarts.

## Implementation Details

- Sessions are now automatically saved to the `backend/sessions/` directory in JSON format
- Each session is stored in a separate file named with its session ID
- When the application starts, it loads all saved sessions from disk
- Sessions are automatically saved when they are:
  - Created
  - Updated (status changes, recording starts/stops, processing completes)
  - Deleted (the file is removed from disk)

## Technical Implementation

The implementation involves two main components:

1. **Session Class Updates:**
   - Added methods for serializing sessions to JSON and deserializing from JSON
   - Added methods for saving/loading sessions to/from disk
   - Added a class method to list all saved sessions

2. **TranscriptionManager Updates:**
   - Added initialization code to load saved sessions from disk
   - Modified session operations to save sessions after state changes
   - Added cleanup code to remove session files when sessions are deleted

## Testing

You can test the persistence feature by:

1. Creating a session and recording/uploading audio
2. Restarting the application 
3. Verifying that the session is still available with all its data

This resolves the issue where sessions weren't persistent between application restarts.
